# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

## About Me 🧑‍💻

Full stack software developer who enjoys all expects of software development (including DevOps!). I love exploring/learning on my own time and consider myself a generalist at heart. Essentially, I like tinker with concepts, and sometimes it yields a few experimental projects along the way.

## Currently Working 🔨

- **[Terrafirma](https://github.com/adelinosousa/terrafirma)**: A collection of opinionated, modular GitHub Actions designed to automate key DevOps and infrastructure workflows. Think plug-and-play actions that handle the boring (but crucial) stuff—so you can focus on the fun parts of your project
- **[gh-cli-auth](https://github.com/adelinosousa/gh-cli-auth)**: Gradle plugin to automatically configure access to GitHub organization maven plugins and packages

## Side Project Graveyard ⚰️

Sometimes ideas live on a bit longer than the projects, so here’s a collection of my more "interesting" side projects. Some were "wild" experiments, others a tad too niche, but each taught me something! 📚

- **[blue-feather](https://github.com/adelinosousa/blue-feather)**: A Web API for managing device notifications.
- **[huh.sh](https://github.com/adelinosousa/huh.sh)**: Encrypted anonymous messaging.
- **[Email Forwarding](https://github.com/adelinosousa/demos/tree/main/EmailForwarding)**: AWS SES Email Forwarding.
- **[CanICore](https://github.com/adelinosousa/canicore)**: Verify .NET Framework project NuGet packages are .NET Core compatible.
