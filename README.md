# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m glad you dropped by. 😄

## About Me 🧑‍💻

I'm a full stack software developer who enjoys all expects of software development (yes, including DevOps!). I love exploring and learning on my own time and consider myself a generalist at heart. Essentially, I like tinker with ideas and concepts, and sometimes it yields a few experimental projects along the way. 😉

## Currently Working 🔨

- **[Terrafirma](https://github.com/adelinosousa/terrafirma)**: A collection of opinionated, modular GitHub Actions designed to automate key DevOps and infrastructure workflows. Think plug-and-play actions that handle the boring (but crucial) stuff—so you can focus on the fun parts of your project 🚀

## Side Project Graveyard ⚰️

Sometimes ideas live on a bit longer than the projects, so here’s a collection of my past side projects. Some were wild experiments, others a tad too niche, but each taught me something! 📚

- **[blue-feather](https://github.com/adelinosousa/blue-feather)**: A Web API for managing device notifications. Because pigeons cannot be trusted! 🪶
- **[huh.sh](https://github.com/adelinosousa/huh.sh)**: Encrypted anonymous messaging. Who said that? 🤐
- **[Email Forwarding](https://github.com/adelinosousa/demos/tree/main/EmailForwarding)**: AWS SES Email Forwarding. Sometimes emails need a little detour on their way to you. 📧➡️
- **[CanICore](https://github.com/adelinosousa/canicore)**: Verify .NET Framework project NuGet packages are .NET Core compatible. Making sure your code isn’t stuck in the past! 📜🔍

Feel free to explore, fork, or simply enjoy the chaos of my projects. And remember, every idea explored adds a little more knowledge to your journey! 🍀
